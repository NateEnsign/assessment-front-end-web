        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
            <p>Early on in my career I want to bust my balls to become the best coder this side of the Mississippi.
                I want to work in companies where there will be senior developers to mentor and coach me to help me along 
                in my coding journey. As I become more proficient and confident in my abilities I want to start some hide 
                hussles making applications that will eventually make me my millions so I can retire early and coach a
                small town high school basketball team and have all the time in the world to backpack, fish, and explore 
                the world like a millenial such as myself was born to do.
